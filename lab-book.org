** Daily

Here will lie my daily thoughts and daily happenings.

*** 2019-05-02

Today the day was basically dedicated to formatting and installing my distro in
my new computer. It has a 4:3 screen, which will surely be kinda funny to work
with. Also my computer only have one analog video entry and 2 displayports, for
some reason.

Anyway, I also researched and learned a lot about =ssh= while I was trying to
get my public key into =portal.inf.ufrgs.br=. With Pablo's and Jean's help I
fixed the permissions of my home directory in the server (the =$HOME= directory
needs the 700 permission to work with =ssh=! Probably someone messed up a few
years back when they created my user).

Tomorrow I'll finish the setting-up ordeal, I hope.

*** 2019-05-03 StarPU Hello World Examples

Before trying anything with StarPU, I tried to run the first experiment in
schnorr/par, which didn't work. The job quits with the exit code =71=, to which
I've found no information online. I'm kinda tired today but next week I'll make
sure that I talk to either Nesi or Marcelo or Matheus about it.

Also I've tried installing StarPU using spack in the cluster, but there was no
StarPU package available.

On the other hand, I did create some folder in my user to organize things up and
I've also set up the ssh keys of my new computer in almost every relevant
website.

*UPDATE*: So, when I got home I continued trying things out. I've tried to
allocate some nodes to try the simplest experiment I've tried earlier and, after
playing around and learning Slurm commands, I've noticed that I cant =ssh= into
any node because my RSA key doesn't match the one in the cluster (or doesn't
exist at all there). Maybe that's the culprit for me not being able to even get
the simplest example running through =sbatch=? I'll contact Schnorr about this.

**** StarPU "Hello World"                                             :LUCAS:
***** Install preliminary software
****** spack

See https://github.com/spack/spack to do:

#+begin_src shell :results output
git clone https://github.com/spack/spack.git
source spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
spack find
#+end_src

Then, add the =solverstack= from the INRIA GitLab:

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://gitlab.inria.fr/solverstack/spack-repo.git solverstack
spack repo add solverstack/
#+end_src

****** starpu with spack

#+begin_src shell :results output
spack info starpu
#+end_src

Verify options, then:

#+begin_src shell :results output
spack install starpu@master~cuda~examples~fast+fortran+fxt+mlr~mpi~nmad~opencl~openmp+poti+shared~simgrid~simgridmc~verbose
#+end_src

This might take some time, do it in the cluster.

Confirm the location of where starpu has been installed

#+begin_src shell :results output
spack location -i starpu
#+end_src

***** StarPU client code of two examples

There are two examples:
- ~programa.c~ (simple one-task hello world)
- ~vector_scal.c~ (multiply a vector by a scalar in parallel)

See contents in [[./experiments/starpu/hello-world/]].

Please note that we are using CMake to find the StarPU libraries.

The, do the following steps (try to understand each one).

Make sure you have ~spack~ in your ~PATH~ variable before going forward.

#+begin_src shell :results output
cd src/starpu-hello-world
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake -DSTARPU_DIR=$(spack location -i starpu) ..
make
#+end_src

You'll have two binaries: ~programa~ and ~vector_scal~.

Verify that they have the correct libraries linked with ~ldd~.

Run both by launching these binaries in your CLI.

*** 2019-05-06

Today I ran the =hello.slurm= file from the first experiment of schnorr/par. I
had to do some modifications to the script so that it would actually find the
executable (as it wasn't finding inside the folder I was running =sbatch= from,
even though it had no trouble compiling it).

Also I've added info about MPI in the External Resources section, which are
really just some tutorials and introductions to the matter. I found the MPI
interface to be rather cumbersome with its C-like functions and inits. Doesn't
a proper C++ wrapper exist somewhere? Maybe that takes away part of the
complexity of the syntax choices. I'll look around.

Also, I'm kinda becoming really attached to my Emacs development environment.
I've gathered quite a few nice =.org= configs and I'm making my own now at
[[https://github.com/hcpsilva/dotfiles/blob/master/.emacs.d/config.org][this]] link.

*** 2019-05-08

I studied a lot of database fundamentals, as I had it's exam by afternoon.

*** 2019-05-09

I started the day by reading about and learning =tmux=, which is, as it's
called, an "terminal multiplexer". Knowing how to use =tmux= will help me to run
commands and close the =ssh= connection, leaving the session open so I can
easily come back and resume the operations and tasks I was performing.

Also, I read the LLNL's tutorial on Linux clusters and gathered a lot of new
resources to complement my =External resources= section (besides learning a lot,
obviously).

*** 2019-05-10

Today I started the day by fixing the multiple =tmux= sessions while =ssh='ing.
So, the issue was that, when I =ssh='ed into the /GPPD/ front-end, I'd make a
check in the =.bashrc= to see if there was a session opened (named "ssh_s") and
attach to it. Thing is, all nodes share the =.bashrc= file, and this would
happen when I =ssh= into the nodes as well.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :tangle yes
# Start a tmux session automatically if coming in from ssh.
if [[ -z "$TMUX" ]] && [ "$SSH_CONNECTION" != "" ]; then
    tmux attach-session -t ssh_s || tmux new-session -s ssh_s
fi
#+END_SRC

To fix this, Matheus suggested that I should add an additional check to the =if=
statement to see the name of the host and only open a new session if the host
was =gppd-hpc=:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :tangle yes
# Start a tmux session automatically if coming in from ssh.
if [[ -z "$TMUX" ]] && [ "$SSH_CONNECTION" != "" ] && [ `hostname` == "gppd-hpc" ]; then
    tmux attach-session -t ssh_s || tmux new-session -s ssh_s
fi
#+END_SRC

I also furthered the development of my org configuration file for Emacs, and
very soon I'll be able to test it, initially still with Prelude and then on pure
Emacs.

Besides that, I talked with professor Erika about the roles of an IC and the
research process and methodologies. She was very helpful, as always. After that,
I talked to Schnorr and arranged a meeting next tuesday to talk about that and some
other things. I shall make a new heading in the "Meetings" to put all the topics
I wish to talk about there.

*** 2019-05-13

As of lunch time, I've updated the =resources= directory and added a new heading
for tomorrow's meeting, in which I've added the topics I wish to discuss.

*** 2019-05-14

I added a bunch of info on reproducible analysis using =R= and I'm currently
watching a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGnt_PWoM5Y][video]] on =org-mode= and reproducible research while I wait for the
meeting.

*** 2019-05-16

We decided in the last meeting that I should modify the StarPU vector example to
do a reduction of the generated vectors. Also I've proposed an object-oriented
approach to the problem using C++, so what I'll do first is set up my Emacs
environment and learn CMake.

Update: Yesterday I was so tired I forgot to push. Also, I had some issues with
a short circuit in my desktop. Thankfully I solved it by removing the CD drive,
which probably was grounding the motherboard.

*** 2019-05-17

My Emacs configuration file has advanced a lot in the last few days. From
yesterday until today I've been trying to get the =cmake-ide= package to
work. Even though I've been failing pretty miserably, I'm getting close.

[[https://github.com/hcpsilva/dotfiles/blob/master/.emacs.d/config.org][Here's]] the link to my config file, by the way.

*** 2019-05-20

I had to scramble in the morning to finish part of an assignment that one of my
group colleagues couldn't finish and which presentation was also today. For that
I couldn't contribute or work in my scholarship project.

*** 2019-05-21                                                     :ATTACH:
:PROPERTIES:
:Attachments: notas-funcionamento-starpu.pdf
:END:

Today I researched a bunch about CMake and how to structure a project that uses
it. CMake in itself is very powerful but with it you can use something like the
Ninja build system, which greatly speeds up the build process as it is
asynchronous in nature.

I did advanced somewhat in the making of my =CMakeLists.txt=, but not enough in
my opinion. I'm taking too long in small details (such as this whole CMake
thing). My primary focus should be to just get it working, as the whole ideal of
creating wrapper classes for the StarPU concepts will already be enough of a
challenge.

In other news, I'm kinda overwhelmed emotionally right now so it's very hard to
keep my focus on things. These are personal issues, I know, but I should be
clear about it, as it impacts my abilities to be effective and to make progress
in my scholarship goals.

*** 2019-05-23                                                     :ATTACH:
:PROPERTIES:
:Attachments: sobre-as-classes.pdf
:END:

Changed the project structure, finished the CMake files and thought more about
the wrapper classes and their possible solutions.

*** 2019-05-24                                                     :ATTACH:
:PROPERTIES:
:Attachments: thoughts-2405.pdf
:END:

Today I advanced somewhat on building the wrapper classes to StarPU, but, while
I read the documentation, I noticed that the task isn't even easy to begin
with. After talking to Schnorr about some questions I had, we decided that if I
focus into getting the vector reduction going I could more easily start working
in more complex applications of StarPU.

So, we defined that next tuesday, 28/05, I should deliver the code so that we
analyze it together.

*** 2019-05-27

I've modified the [[./experiments/starpu/vector-reduction/vector_scal.cc]] code and
now it should do the reduction as expected. I couldn't test it though, as I've
failed to link properly the StarPU libraries. I'll keep trying tomorrow.

*** 2019-05-28

With Nesi's help I was able to compile my vector testing. The whole fundamentals
of how should each task perform its job and, if necessary, write its results to
a memory handle (which are registered so there is sharing of data between tasks)
I understood. To me, it isn't very clear how you would partition an application
to take advantage of said task-based parallelism (and I think this is the
important part).

If I try for long enough, I can get a working version of this code going, but
then what's the point if I don't know how to take advantage of my know-how (in
terms of "I somewhat know how to build a simple StarPU application")? Also, I
tried looking for the slides from the PCAM class but I didn't find them.

*** 2019-06-07

Today I've talked to Schnorr about my interest in staying in the group and in
the new theme of the internship project (2019 - 2020).

Also I've discussed with him the preparations for the SIC2019. I'll write a
summary about my internship so far and the themes it encompasses (the deadline
is 21/06).

*** 2019-06-08

So far the summary has a nice looking title and authors section. Anyway, I've
talked to Valeria yesterday and she sent me her summary for last year's
SIC. I'll use it as reference when I start making mine.

*** 2019-06-09

I've reorganized the =starpu-cpp= repository, which for now stays private. I
have no intentions of making it public any time soon, as the StarPU project uses
a custom version of the GPL-v3 and its purpose is for my benefit only. When it's
working I'll consider making it public.

I intend to write some more of the SIC summary today, but I'll focus on trying
to finish the vector reduction code.

*** 2019-06-14

I've fixed the CMakeLists from the vector reduction code and now it works! Also
I've made some helper functions and the code is now easier to read.

*** 2019-06-15

The vector reduction code is now working! The development cycle was greatly
diminished when I installed StarPU in my computer (go figure huh).

There are some not-that-great fixes to make the code work, but in my opinion
it's pretty good.

*** 2019-06-16

There is a much simpler way to do the data partitioning between the tasks. Here
follow some links to help me in the future:

- [[http://starpu.gforge.inria.fr/doc/html/group__API__Data__Partition.html#gac24101bbe28b1d7d4a0874d349ba8979][get_sub_data]]

*** 2019-06-17

The following link is /really/ useful when you're introducing loads of concepts
of parallel computing:
[[https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/parallel_comp/]]

*** 2019-06-18

Today I've talked to Schnorr and defined that finishing the summary text for the
SIC 2019 is the objective for now. We have defined some points of improvement in
the text and what the last paragraph should talk about.

*** 2019-06-19

With Nesi's help I finished the summary text for SIC 2019. I think there's not
much else to add, but I suppose we could add some small executions of the code?
Though talking about that would require more text space.

*** 2019-06-22

I've made a working vector reduction using StarPU's vector partition and
unpartition (as in using sub-handles and such). Some preliminary testing has
shown that it works kinda well.

*** 2019-06-23

Small code fix and that's it.

*** 2019-07-02

In order to get myself back on track, I'll do here a to-do list of what I think
should be done next.

/To-do/:

1. *Experiment with the vector reduction code*
2. *Talk more with people about writing that article to WSCAD*
3. *Make a vector or matrix multiplication version*

*** 2019-07-14

So, my semester has ended! I'm updating the to-do list and getting what I need
to do under control. That being said, I should recap things with either Nesi or
Schnorr.

*** 2019-07-15

It's one thing to check the malloc returns and to create a macro to print log
messages, but it's a whole different ordeal to free all mallocs with
StarPU. I'll look into the runtime's own ways to do this.

Also (and kinda related to the previous point) I should check out the supported
data reduction mechanism that StarPU provides. If I follow the rules of the
game, the malloc freeing thing shouldn't be an issue.

*** 2019-07-16

Today there was not much progress today but I did some reading of papers!

** Meetings

This could stay inside its respective entry in the daily journal, but I think
that separating meetings from the dailies is better.

*** 2019-05-14 Meeting

Topic I want to talk about:

- Current learning stack/path :: as exposed in [[Learning path][the learning path]]
- Current progression :: in terms of task completion rate
- Organization and discipline :: assiduity, compromise and hours completed

Goals:
- [ ] Change starpu hello-world ~vector_scal.cc~ to have a new task with
  a new code to compute the reduction of the resulting vectors. The
  reduction has to be the sum operation.
- [ ] Implement a new starpu program to compute the dot product as
  defined in https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Produto_escalar

Think about:
- [ ] Try to remember how the LU decomposition algorithm works, and
  think about how to implement using tasks.
- [ ] How to implement the Mandelbrot with StarPU tasks?
  - Promote discussing about scheduling algorithms
  - Promote discussing about load imbalance

*** 2019-05-28 Meeting

Fixed implementation of ~vector_scal~

To-do:
- Finish the fixed implementation
  - Use valgrind to verify memory leaks
  - Make sure all leaks are gone
    - All numbers reported by Valgrind should be zero
- Do a multi-level reduction scheme using an additional parameter that
  will tell you how much aggregation is carried out in each level
- Think about an application you are interested in
  - It can be some simulation, whatever
  - By default, we go to some linear algebra factorization
- Perhaps change the ~vector_scal~ problem to a ~vector_multiplication~
  - The initial task ~cpu_func~ will have two implementations, one in
    CPU and another for GPU (in this case, use tupi1 with 2 GPUs)
- Create a SLURM script to run all experiments
  - Check ERAD/RS shortcourse

- Take a look at https://github.com/schnorr/starvz/tree/master/src
  - Copy ~fxt2paje~ and ~paje_sort~
- Usage example:

  #+begin_src shell :results output
  pushd ~/svn/henrique/ic/code/starpu/vector-reduction/build/
  ../bin/vector_reduc 1000 50 2
  popd
  source ~/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
  export PATH=$(spack location -i starpu/l43k3yq)/bin/:$PATH
  wget -nc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schnorr/starvz/master/src/fxt2paje.sh
  wget -nc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schnorr/starvz/master/src/paje_sort.sh
  chmod 755 fxt2paje.sh paje_sort.sh
  export PATH=$(pwd):$PATH
  mkdir -p /tmp/teste/
  cp /tmp/prof_file_* /tmp/teste/
  cd /tmp/teste/
  fxt2paje.sh
  twopi dag.dot -Tpng -o x.png
  pj_dump --user-defined paje.sorted.trace > paje.sorted.csv
  cat paje.sorted.csv | grep ^State | grep Worker\ State | grep Reduction | grep -v "0.000000, 0.000000" > rastro.csv

*** 2019-07-19 Meeting

Talk about possible future paths:
- Partial Differential Equations
- 1D CFD (rod as in 3blue1brown)
- *Ondes3D*
- Gaps in the DAG (aka gapness of scheduler decisions)

About the current objective (DAG and StarPU):
- Full factorial design -> CSV -> Slurm script -> execute
  - Check ERAD/RS 2019 mini course "Boas práticas"

For WSPPD we established that this small case study should be our object. So, we
analyze the execution times for the experiment above, given the defined
variables, in a bunch of partitions in the cluster.

* External resources
:PROPERTIES:
:ATTACH_DIR: resources/external/
:ATTACH_DIR_INHERIT: t
:END:

Here I'll categorize useful resources I've found while "aggressively" googling
and/or reading papers and other documents.

** Linux

Any useful Linux knowledge relevant to my activities should stay here.

*** tmux

#+begin_quote
=tmux= is a terminal multiplexer for Unix-like operating systems. It allows
multiple terminal sessions to be accessed simultaneously in a single window. It
is useful for running more than one command-line program at the same time. It
can also be used to detach processes from their controlling terminals, allowing
SSH sessions to remain active without being visible.

** Servers

Here lies all knowledge I don't possess about servers and cluster and so on and
so forth.

*** Clusters

- [[https://whatis.suse.com/definition/linux-cluster/][Definition]]

/Tutorials/:

- [[https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/tutorials/clustering/clustering.html][IBM]]
  From 2002 but still explains a lot of the fundamental concepts.
- [[https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/linux_clusters/][LLNL]]
  Huge! Includes exercises, Slurm, GPU clusters, and much more.
- [[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Computer_cluster][Wikipedia]]
  Explains pretty well in layman terms what is a cluster.

*** Slurm

#+begin_quote
Slurm is an open source, fault-tolerant, and highly scalable cluster management
and job scheduling system for large and small Linux clusters.
#+end_quote

- [[https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html][Documentation]]

/Tutorials/:

- [[https://slurm.schedmd.com/tutorials.html][Documentation tutorial]]
- [[https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/moab/][LLNL's tutorial]]

**** Useful commands:

 - =sacct= :: is used to report job or job step accounting information about active
            or completed jobs.

 - =salloc= :: is used to allocate resources for a job in real time. Typically this
             is used to allocate resources and spawn a shell.

 - =sattach= :: is used to attach standard input, output, and error plus signal
              capabilities to a currently running job or job step. One can attach
              to and detach from jobs multiple times.

 - =sbatch= :: is used to submit a job script for later execution. The script will
             typically contain one or more srun commands to launch parallel tasks.

 - =sbcast= :: is used to transfer a file from local disk to local disk on the
             nodes allocated to a job.

 - =scancel= :: is used to cancel a pending or running job or job step. It can also
              be used to send an arbitrary signal to all processes associated
              with a running job or job step.

 - =sinfo= :: reports the state of partitions and nodes managed by Slurm. It has a
            wide variety of filtering, sorting, and formatting options.

 - =smap= :: reports state information for jobs, partitions, and nodes managed by
           Slurm, but graphically displays the information to reflect network
           topology.

 - =squeue= :: reports the state of jobs or job steps. By default, it reports the
             running jobs in priority order and then the pending jobs in priority
             order.

 - =srun= :: is used to submit a job for execution or initiate job steps in real
           time.

 - =strigger= :: is used to set, get or view event triggers. Event triggers
               include things such as nodes going down or jobs approaching their
               time limit.

 - =sview= :: is a graphical user interface to get and update state information for
            jobs, partitions, and nodes managed by Slurm.

 All command's manuals are in =man=, so no worries if this is to little info.

*** Spack

#+begin_quote
Spack is a package management tool designed to support multiple versions and
configurations of software on a wide variety of platforms and environments. It
was designed for large supercomputing centers, where many users and application
teams share common installations of software on clusters with exotic
architectures, using libraries that do not have a standard ABI.

  - [[https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html][Tutorial]]

*** PCAD

The GPPD manages the High Performance Computation Park (PCAD) and is the group
I'm part of!

- [[http://gppd-hpc.inf.ufrgs.br/][Presentation]]

** Programming

Here lies all programming and HPC-related knowledge.

*** MPI

#+begin_quote
Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a standardized and portable message-passing
standard designed by a group of researchers from academia and industry to
function on a wide variety of parallel computing architectures.
#+end_quote

- [[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Message_Passing_Interface][Wikipedia]]
- [[https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/mpi/][LLNL's Tutorial]]

**** C++ wrappers

I've gathered some info about MPI wrappers for C++ (because I like both
simplicity and C++).

- [[https://blogs.cisco.com/performance/the-mpi-c-bindings-what-happened-and-why][2012 state of affairs]]

Examples:

- [[https://github.com/boostorg/mpi][boost.mpi]]
- [[https://github.com/patflick/mxx][mxx]]

So it seems to me that either the community has no interest in bindings and
simplicity or things move really slowly when it comes to standards proposed by
scholars and academics.

*** CUDA

#+begin_quote
CUDA is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface
(API) model created by Nvidia.It allows software developers and software
engineers to use a CUDA-enabled graphics processing unit (GPU) for general
purpose processing — an approach termed GPGPU (General-Purpose computing on
Graphics Processing Units).

*** StarPU                                                         :ATTACH:

#+begin_quote
StarPU is a software tool aiming to allow programmers to exploit the computing
power of the available CPUs and GPUs, while relieving them from the need to
specially adapt their programs to the target machine and processing units.

*** Design of parallel applications

#+begin_quote
Parallel algorithm design is not easily reduced to simple recipes. Rather, it
requires the sort of integrative thought that is commonly referred to as
"creativity.'' However, it can benefit from a methodical approach that maximizes
the range of options considered, that provides mechanisms for evaluating
alternatives, and that reduces the cost of backtracking from bad choices.

** Research methodology

Everything related from writing to research methodology should stay here.

*** Literate programming                                             :ATTACH:

#+begin_quote
Literate programming is a programming paradigm introduced by Donald Knuth in
which a program is given as an explanation of the program logic in a natural
language, such as English, interspersed with snippets of macros and traditional
source code, from which a compilable source code can be generated.
#+end_quote

Literate programming can be easily achieved using =.org= files, as they provide
text intertwined together with source code blocks, as well as providing a way to
compile these code blocks into one or multiple source files and to execute that
code natively.

Donald Knuth's original paper is attached to this heading as a reference.

*** Reproducible analysis

#+begin_quote
The term reproducible research refers to the idea that the ultimate product of
academic research is the paper along with the laboratory notebooks and full
computational environment used to produce the results in the paper such as the
code, data, etc. that can be used to reproduce the results and create new work
based on the research.
#+end_quote

Essential to research as a whole, reproducible analysis allows the researcher to
establish trust, even years after arriving to results, in his conclusions. Using
common methods comprising data, annotations and code such as a [[https://jupyter.org/][Jupyter]] notebook
or a =.org= file using =R= script in code blocks, following the literate
programming paradigm.

Tutorials about how this topic is dealt in the R realm:

- [[http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/][R reproducible analysis]]

General culture about this sensitive topic: "The Irreproducibility
Crisis of Modern Science: Causes, Consequences, and the Road to
Reform" par Randall et Welser, 2018.

** Documents and presentations

Here I'll put everything related to creating quality presentations and documents
overall.

*** Posters

#+begin_quote
O regramento é que o poster deve ser de 120cm de altura por 80cm de largura,
equipados com madeira (na parte superior) e corda para fixação nos suportes. No
pôster devem constar o título do trabalho, nomes dos autores e respectivas
afiliações. É bem importante levar em conta que o papel do pôster é dar uma
visão geral do trabalho, logo algumas dicas importantes podem ser levadas em
conta, tais como pouco texto (como em uma apresentação de slides), uso de
figuras para transmitir ideias, ser legível a pelo menos dois metros de
distância.
